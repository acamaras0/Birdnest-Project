# Birdy - Drone Surveillance Birdnest Project

## App Deployed @ [Birdy](https://birdnest-client-0et7.onrender.com/)

*A rare and endangered Monadikuikka has been spotted nesting at a local lake.*
*Unfortunately some enthusiasts have been a little too curious about this elusive bird species, flying their drones very close to the nest for rare photos and bothering the birds in the process.*
*To preserve the nesting peace, authorities have declared the area within 100 meters of the nest a no drone zone (NDZ).*

**Birdy** is a drone surveillance website, that displays the contact informations and the drone informations of all the pilots that entered the NDZ. The information is updated every 2 seconds and is kept for 10 minutes.
